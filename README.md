# Network Vulnerability Scanner

This is a network vulnerability scanner that performs network scanning, parsing scan results, searching for vulnerabilities, exploiting vulnerabilities, and generating payloads.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- nmap (installed on the system)
- Other Python modules (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

1. Install Python 3.x from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Install the `nmap` utility using the package manager of your operating system. For example, on Ubuntu, you can run the following command:

   ```shell
   sudo apt install nmap
```
3. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone <repository_url>
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd network-vulnerability-scanner
```

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the required Python modules using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Configure the scanner by modifying the config.py file. Update the network range, scan flags, database name, Metasploit RPC server details, payload options, etc., as per your requirements.

Run the scanner by executing the main.py file:
```
python main.py
```
The scanner will perform network scanning, parsing, vulnerability searching, exploitation, and payload generation based on the configuration specified in config.py.

View the scan results, vulnerabilities, and sessions in the SQLite database specified by config.db_name.

Generated payloads will be saved in the specified output files or formats based on the payload options in config.py.
